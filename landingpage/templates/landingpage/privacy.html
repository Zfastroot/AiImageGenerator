            <p style="font-weight: bold;text-align: center; margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%; ">We may share the information that we collect, both personal and non-personal, with our current and future affiliated companies and business partners, and if we are involved in a merger, asset sale or other business reorganization, we may also share or transfer your personal and non-personal information to our successors-in-interest.

                We may engage trusted third party service providers to perform functions and provide services to us, such as hosting and maintaining our servers and the website, database storage and management, e-mail management, storage marketing, credit card processing, customer service and fulfilling orders for products and services you may purchase through the website. We will likely share your personal information, and possibly some non-personal information, with these third parties to enable them to perform these services for us and for you.
                
                We may share portions of our log file data, including IP addresses, for analytics purposes with third parties such as web analytics partners, application developers, and ad networks. If your IP address is shared, it may be used to estimate general location and other technographics such as connection speed, whether you have visited the website in a shared location, and type of the device used to visit the website.
                
                They may aggregate information about our advertising and what you see on the website and then provide auditing, research and reporting for us and our advertisers.
                
                We may also disclose personal and non-personal information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate in order to respond to claims, legal process (including subpoenas), to protect our rights and interests or those of a third party, the safety of the public or any person, to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity, or to otherwise comply with applicable court orders, laws, rules and regulations.</p>
            <h2 style="color: blueviolet;text-align: center;">Where and when is information collected from customers and end users?</h2>

You can cancel your participation in any of these email lists at any time by clicking on the opt-out link or other unsubscribe option that is included in the respective email. We only send emails to people who have authorized us to contact them, either directly, or through a third party.

                We do not send unsolicited commercial emails, because we hate spam as much as you do. By submitting your email address, you also agree to allow us to use your email address for customer audience targeting on sites, where we display custom advertising to specific people who have opted-in to receive communications from us. Note: If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, we include detailed unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each email.</p>
            <h2 style="color: blueviolet;text-align: center;">How Do We Use Your Email Address?</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;text-align: center; margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%; ">We keep your information only so long as we need it to provide Thelinks to you and fulfill the purposes described in this policy. This is also the case for anyone that we share your information with and who carries out services on our behalf. When we no longer need to use your information and there is no need for us to keep it to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations, we’ll either remove it from our systems or depersonalize it so that we can't identify you.</p> 
            <h2 style="color: blueviolet;text-align: center;">How Long Do We Keep Your Information?</h2>  
            <p style="font-weight: bold;text-align: center; margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%; ">Our project leveraged a range of technologies, including Stable Diffusion for accessing AI models, Django for backend development, Pillow for image processing, and a plethora of other tools and frameworks. Each technology was carefully chosen to optimize performance and functionality, ensuring a seamless user experience.</p>
            <h2 style="color: blueviolet;text-align: center;">How Do We Protect Your Information?</h2>  
            <p style="font-weight: bold;text-align: center; margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%; ">We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you place an order or enter, submit, or access your personal information. We offer the use of a secure server. All supplied sensitive/credit information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our Payment gateway providers database only to be accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential.

                After a transaction, your private information (credit cards, social security numbers, financials, etc.) is never kept on file. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the absolute security of any information you transmit to Thelinks or guarantee that your information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by a breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards..</p>
